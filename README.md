# Dotfiles

Personal development environment configuration for a Linux-based workflow.
This repository reflects how I work day-to-day rather than a standalone “project”.

The configurations are modular, version-controlled, and tailored for a keyboard-driven, minimal desktop and terminal-centric setup.

---

## Overview

This repository contains configuration for:

- **Shells**
  - `bash/`
  - `zsh/`

- **Editor**
  - `nvim/` — Neovim configuration (plugins, LSP, formatting, keybindings)

- **Terminal & Multiplexing**
  - `tmux/` — session management and workflow optimization

- **Window Management & Desktop**
  - `i3/` — tiling window manager configuration
  - `picom/` — compositor
  - `x11/` — X11-related configuration
  - `dunst/` — notification daemon

- **Tooling & Utilities**
  - `git/` — git configuration and aliases
  - `newsboat/` — RSS feed reader
  - `latex/` — LaTeX tooling and templates
  - `fonts/` — user-installed fonts

## Philosophy

- Minimal and functional over flashy
- Keyboard-driven workflows
- Explicit configuration over defaults
- Reproducibility and clarity

These dotfiles evolve as my tooling and workflow evolve.

## Status

This repository is:
- Used for personal development
- Not intended as a general-purpose framework
- Not guaranteed to be portable across systems without modification

It is kept public as a reference for cloning and as supporting evidence of familiarity with:
- Unix-like systems
- Developer tooling
- Editor and window manager customization

## Notes

Some paths, environment variables, or system-specific assumptions may need adjustment when used on a different machine.
